Within this Trial I going to try to learn and understand how to implement the vulkan more deeply.
The program will focus on combining the basic instuction from the FirstVulkan program and the Vulkan Tutorial done by SaschaWillems
Triangle_tutorial.cpp, vulkanexamplebase.h, vulkanexample.cpp can be access directly from https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

While the triangle.cpp is the code from my very first vulkan. This program is on progress and will have update soon.
